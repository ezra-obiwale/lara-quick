# Attachable Trait

Shortcut methods to making working with related many-to-many models faster. It is
intended to be used with the [Api trait](/v1/controllers/traits/api).

<p class="tip">
    See [Laravel Doc](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/eloquent-relationships#updating-many-to-many-relationships)
</p>

<p class="tip">
    These methods are meant to be called from within custom endpoint methods and
    not used directly as the parameters would need to be customized.

    For ready-made endpoint methods, use the [Pivotable trait](/v1/controllers/traits/pivotable).

## Route Methods

### attach ( `...` )

<p class="tip no-bg">
    public function attach ( `mixed` $id, `string` $relation, `string` $paramKey = 'items' ) : `Illuminate\Http\Response`
</p>

### detach ( `...` )

<p class="tip no-bg">
    public function detach ( `mixed` $id, `string` $relation, `string` $paramKey = 'items' ) : `Illuminate\Http\Response`
</p>

### sync ( `...` )

<p class="tip no-bg">
    public function sync ( `mixed` $id, `string` $relation, `string` $paramKey = 'items' ) : `Illuminate\Http\Response`
